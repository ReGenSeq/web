POSE: Phase 1: Creation of an open source ecosystem to repurpose DNA sequencers as an automation platform
A.	Summary of Proposed Work
A.1	Product Description: The proposed Open Source Ecosystem (OSE) centers on PySeq, a Python-based open-source control software developed to repurpose decommissioned next-generation DNA sequencers into flexible platforms for automating a wide range of complex biological assays. These high-throughput sequencers, once used for state-of-the-art parallel DNA sequencing but now largely obsoleted by newer models, are sophisticated instruments equipped with advanced optical, fluidic, and precision motion control subsystems. Although no longer supported for their original purpose, thousands of these machines remain deployed at universities, research institutes, and national laboratories. Critically, without accessible control software, these instruments are, despite their underlying technical capabilities, functionally inert. PySeq addresses this limitation by providing low-level access to core hardware components (e.g., lasers, pumps, stages, cameras) and high-level control routines, allowing users to implement custom protocols and adapt the hardware to novel applications.
A.2	A Typical User Description: A typical user of PySeq is a biomedical researcher with access to a decommissioned next-generation DNA sequencer, seeking to perform spatial biology applications. In most cases, the sequencer is transferred from their institution’s sequencing core lab, or purchased on a secondary market. As of now, PySeq fully supports the Illumina HiSeq 2500 sequencer and is adapted to perform complex immunohistochemistry assays. In principle, it can be adapted to support a much wider range of instruments and complex high-throughput assays. Although commercial platforms for high-throughput assay automation are available, they are often prohibitively expensive, with instrument costs exceeding $500,000—placing them beyond the reach of many smaller institutions. In contrast, decommissioned sequencers can be acquired for as little as $3,000, making PySeq a highly attractive solution for resource-constrained environments, including small academic laboratories, early-stage biomedical startups, teaching institutions, and research programs in low- and middle-income countries. By unlocking the latent capabilities of otherwise idle instrumentation, PySeq broadens access to state-of-the-art experimental technologies, encourages innovation in under-resourced settings, and promotes the democratization of high-throughput laboratory automation.
A.3	Current stage of the OSE development: Currently, the primary development and use of PySeq is based in the Technology Innovation Laboratory at the New York Genome Center (NYGC). Sequencer-specific control software has been developed for Illumina HiSeq 2500 (pyseq2500, in production) and HiSeq 2000 (pyseq2501, production ready but not widely tested). An image processing pipeline has also been developed to facilitate analysis of images produced by the sequencers. In parallel, a small but growing number of external laboratories (greater than 10 at present) are engaged in repurposing their own decommissioned sequencers for similar purposes. New users/developers learn about PySeq after finding our publication and contacting us. To support these users, we provide guidance through an active Zulip-based online forum, where members can ask questions, share progress, and troubleshoot issues collaboratively. PySeq is distributed via GitHub under a permissive MIT license, and user documentation is available online. Nevertheless, the lack of a formal governance structure, centralized coordination, and dedicated communication infrastructure has limited the pace of development and user adoption. The proposed OSE aims to address these challenges by establishing a sustainable community framework that supports ongoing development, comprehensive documentation, user training, and the long-term maintenance of a self-sustaining, open-source platform.

Kaspar aligned the Hacketeria efforts using a HiSeq 2000 with Dr. Kunal Pandit’s efforts using the HiSeq 2500 through regular knowledge exchange meetings.


B.	Justification for Supplemental Funding
B.1	Broad Impact of the OSE: Development of PySeq OSE will have four major broader impacts:
By providing affordable, user-friendly automation tools, it will increase the throughput and accessibility of advanced single-cell assays, thereby enabling a broader range of researchers to generate high-quality single-cell data critical for studying diseases like cancer and neurodegeneration. 
By lowering the cost and expertise barriers to automation, it will democratize science and expand access to cutting-edge methods beyond elite institutions. 
By repurposing obsolete scientific instruments, the project will model sustainable resource management and foster collaboration across academia, industry, and government, encouraging more efficient use of equipment while advancing environmentally responsible scientific innovation. 
By giving users and developers full control over both data and data processing, it will enhance transparency, security, and privacy in contrast to commercial closed-box platforms. In practice, safety and privacy will be maintained through GitHub’s automated security checks, including the OpenSSF Scorecard, which will continuously monitor and improve the project’s security.
B.2	PySeq OSE sustainability: Beyond the POSE Phase I award, the sustainability of the PySeq OSE will rely on the community, infrastructure, and collaborative practices established during the project. We will continue to support and grow the user and developer base through resources developed during POSE—such as the forums, GitHub repositories, documentation, media channels and training materials—which will remain openly available and maintained by core contributors, including our team. Over time, we expect the community to become increasingly self-sufficient through decentralized exchange of protocols, documentation, and software improvements. As users adapt PySeq to new sequencer models and integrate additional automation tools, the platform will expand beyond spatial biology into a versatile, general-purpose system for experimental automation. By promoting open collaboration and shared development, PySeq OSE will continue to grow in functionality and reach, supporting an expanding range of instruments and applications well beyond the initial award period.
B.3	I-Corps for POSE Training: The I-Corps for POSE training will be instrumental in helping us transition PySeq from an open-source project into a sustainable OSE by enabling us to:
Engage in direct conversations with active and potential users, developers, and institutional stakeholders to move beyond assumptions and uncover real-world challenges in adopting repurposed DNA sequencers for automation.
Identify which instruments and applications are most in demand and where users face friction in setup, use, or integration.
Refine documentation, onboarding procedures, and governance strategies to better support a growing and diverse contributor base.
Encourage and empower the community to take the lead in extending support to additional instruments and automation workflows.
Interact with other open-source teams to facilitate knowledge exchange, peer learning, and potential collaborations.
Receive structured guidance and mentorship to help us design a decentralized, community-driven model that can evolve and thrive well beyond the initial POSE award.

Supplemental funding will support the active participation of our Industry Mentor (IM), whose time commitment (40 hrs of I-Corps meetings and 8 hrs of consultation) is critical to the success of the I-Corps training and long-term sustainability of the OSE. His involvement will strengthen our ability to engage a technically skilled developer base, recruit contributors, and design contributor workflows that follow open-source best practices. In addition to attending I-Corps kickoff and weekly meetings, he will advise on community engagement strategy, connect us with broader developer networks, and provide targeted feedback on governance and tooling. This strategic guidance will be crucial for building a resilient and scalable ecosystem from the outset.
Finally, to help discover a deeper understanding of the motivations, needs, and bottlenecks within the community, our TL and EL will take part in the annual meeting of the American Society of Human Genetics (from October 14-18 in Boston, MA). The meeting will be attended by sequencing core directors, sequencer users, bioinformatics developers, sequencing companies, and spatial biology companies, all of whom are stakeholders in our OSE.
B.4	Developer Community Interaction: A central part of the PySeq OSE vision is to build a community-driven development model in which priorities are guided by the needs and input of its users and contributors. To support this, we will establish inclusive mechanisms for community feedback and decision-making. These will include regular community calls, GitHub issue discussions, polls, and shared project roadmaps that invite input from contributors across institutions. We will use proven tools and strategies to engage a distributed developer community and ensure their feedback directly shapes the evolution of the platform. Contributor guidelines will be published to help new developers quickly onboard, and GitHub will serve as the central coordination platform. Development tasks will be organized and tracked using GitHub Projects, which will generate issues and pull requests aligned with priority areas. Contributors will be encouraged to work on these issues and submit changes via pull requests, with collaborative review prior to integration. Regular virtual meetings with core developers will help maintain alignment and address critical challenges in real time. This interactive, feedback-driven approach will ensure that PySeq OSE grows in directions that reflect the evolving needs of its ecosystem and fosters a culture of open collaboration from the outset.
